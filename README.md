## bench-wf-creation-client

Temporary repository, mainly used as backup
  
## Usage
The script requires a config-localhost.json file at the same level (see bench-wf-creation.js)

You must have installed nuxeo.js of course (`npm install nuxeo@2 --save`).

Then, setup the config-localhost.json and run `node bench-wf-creation.js`
